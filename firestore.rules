/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Blogify CMS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to blog posts, while restricting write access to authenticated users (admins).
 * Subscriptions are managed by admins only.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/blog_posts/{blogPostId}: Stores public blog post data.
 * - /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Stores subscription data, accessible only to admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for blog posts is enabled.
 * - Admin role is implicitly determined by authentication status. Only authenticated users can write blog posts or subscriptions.
 * - The rules do NOT enforce the exact schema of the data, focusing on access control.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - None: Blog posts are publicly readable; admin status is determined by authentication.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public blog posts are stored in a top-level collection, separate from any private user data.
