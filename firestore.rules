/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Blogify Blog Posts.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is designed to secure blog posts created via an embeddable script,
 * allowing read access to anyone but restricting write access to authorized origins.
 * The central idea is Authorization Independence, achieved through the denormalization
 * of the `originUrl` field on each `BlogPost` document. This allows the rules to
 * authorize write requests based solely on the contents of the document being written,
 * without needing to perform expensive or impossible `get()` operations on related documents.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Blog posts are stored in the `artifacts/{appId}/public/data/blog_posts/{blogPostId}`
 * collection.  The `appId` isolates artifacts across different Firebase Apps. Each
 * `BlogPost` document contains metadata about the post including an `originUrl` field
 * representing the website where it was created.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All blog posts are publicly readable.
 * - Origin-Based Write Access: Writes (create, update, delete) are restricted to requests
 *   where the `originUrl` matches the origin of the request.
 * - No User Authentication Required: Posts can be created without user authentication using anonymous authentication.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `originUrl` field is denormalized into the `BlogPost` document to enable
 * origin-based authorization without needing to perform `get()` operations.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Not applicable in this case, as all blog posts created via the embeddable script
 * are treated the same way (publicly accessible).

     *   Example: request.auth == null && request.resource.data.originUrl == 'https://example.com'
     * @allow (update): A request with a matching `originUrl` can update a blog post.
     *   Example: request.auth == null && resource.data.originUrl == 'https://example.com'
     * @allow (delete): A request with a matching `originUrl` can delete a blog post.
     *   Example: request.auth == null && resource.data.originUrl == 'https://example.com'
     * @deny (create): A request with a mismatched `originUrl` is rejected.
     *   Example: request.auth == null && request.resource.data.originUrl == 'https://evil.com'
     * @deny (update): A request with a mismatched `originUrl` is rejected.
     *   Example: request.auth == null && resource.data.originUrl == 'https://evil.com'
     * @deny (delete): A request with a mismatched `originUrl` is rejected.
     *   Example: request.auth == null && resource.data.originUrl == 'https://evil.com'
     * @principle Enforces origin-based authorization for write operations on blog posts.
